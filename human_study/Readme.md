## prompt we input to those LLMsï¼š  
Now you are a value dynamics predictor. Based on the score vectors of six value dimensions for 10 participants, you need to predict their willingness to choose actions in different scenarios, sorted from high to low based on their emphasis on different values. The six dimensions, in order, are: curiosity, energy, safety, happiness, intimacy, fairness. The scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater importance placed on that value dimension.  
Participants' scores on the six dimensions are as follows:  
person_id=1: [0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7]  
person_id=2: [0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]  
person_id=3: [0.2, 0.6, 0.9, 0.8, 0.5, 0.7]  
person_id=4: [0.9, 0.6, 1.0, 0.8, 0.9, 0.9]  
person_id=5: [0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.6]  
person_id=6: [1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.7, 1.0]  
person_id=7: [0.5, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.4]  
person_id=8: [0.8, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6, 0.6, 0.3]  
person_id=9: [0.5, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.3, 0.7]  
person_id=10: [0.6, 0.8, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.6]  
The Test_questionnaire.json contains 11 scenarios and corresponding actions. You need to return the prediction results in JSON format as follows:
